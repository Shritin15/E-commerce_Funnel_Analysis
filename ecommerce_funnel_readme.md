# E-commerce Funnel Analysis

A comprehensive data analysis project that uncovered critical insights into e-commerce conversion rates and identified key opportunities for business growth through systematic funnel analysis.

## Project Overview

This project analyzes user behavior in an e-commerce sales funnel to identify conversion bottlenecks and provide actionable business recommendations. Through systematic diagnostic analysis and hypothesis testing, we discovered that apparent product performance issues were actually masking deeper data quality problems and user acquisition inconsistencies.

## Key Findings

### Primary Discovery
- **Cart-to-purchase rate**: Exceptionally high at **66.2%**
- **View-to-cart rate**: Significantly lower, indicating the main conversion bottleneck occurs at the top of the funnel
- **Root cause**: Combination of data quality issues and inconsistent user acquisition strategies

### Critical Insight
The November user cohort showed a **3x higher conversion rate** compared to October, revealing that the business successfully acquired a more engaged user segment through improved marketing strategies.

## Methodology

### 1. Overall Funnel Analysis
**Objective**: Establish baseline funnel health
- Calculated `view_to_cart_rate`, `cart_to_purchase_rate`, and `overall_conversion_rate`
- Identified top-of-funnel optimization as primary opportunity

### 2. Diagnostic Analysis Roadmap
**Objective**: Drill down to identify root causes

#### Analysis 1: Product & Category Performance
- Discovered products with **0% view-to-cart conversion** despite high view counts
- Identified systematic underperformance at category level

#### Analysis 2: Brand-Level Investigation
- Extended analysis to brand dimension
- Confirmed entire brands showing **0% conversion rates**
- Validated systematic nature of the problem

#### Analysis 3: User Engagement Correlation
- Analyzed session duration vs. conversion behavior
- Established strong correlation between time-on-site and cart additions

### 3. Hypothesis Testing
**Objective**: Validate root cause theories

#### Hypothesis 1: Data Quality Issues
- **Method**: Investigated missing data patterns in products with active traffic
- **Result**: Confirmed - Underperforming products had NULL brands and $0 prices, despite receiving views (proving they were live on the website)
- **Impact**: Data integrity issues affecting user experience and conversion tracking for actively displayed products

#### Hypothesis 2: User Acquisition Variations
- **Method**: Cohort analysis comparing October vs November users
- **Result**: Confirmed - November cohort showed 3x higher conversion rates
- **Impact**: User quality significantly impacts funnel performance

## Advanced Analysis Techniques

### Cohort Analysis Deep Dive
- **Segmentation Strategy**: Compared user behavior across monthly acquisition cohorts
- **Behavioral Profiling**: Analyzed session duration, page views, and engagement patterns
- **Retention Correlation**: Connected acquisition timing to long-term conversion behavior

### Data Quality Impact Measurement
- **Cross-Reference Analysis**: Matched product performance to data completeness
- **User Journey Mapping**: Tracked how missing data affected user progression through funnel
- **Conversion Attribution**: Isolated data quality impact from other performance factors

### Statistical Validation
- **Sample Size Verification**: Ensured findings were statistically significant across cohorts
- **Confidence Intervals**: Calculated margins of error for conversion rate differences
- **Outlier Analysis**: Identified and validated extreme performance variations

### Business Insights

#### Strategic Discoveries
1. **Hidden High-Performance Engine**: The 66.2% cart-to-purchase rate reveals the business has excellent product-market fit and checkout optimization. The low overall conversion isn't a product problem - it's a traffic quality and data presentation problem.

2. **November Success Blueprint**: The 3x conversion improvement in November represents a breakthrough in user acquisition. This cohort didn't just convert better, they demonstrated fundamentally different engagement patterns, suggesting the business found its ideal customer profile.

3. **Data Quality as Revenue Driver**: Products with missing brand/price data weren't just database errors, they were live products actively losing sales.

#### Quantified Impact
- **Revenue Recovery Potential**: Fixing data quality issues could immediately improve conversion rates without additional marketing spend
- **Scalability Opportunity**: Replicating November's acquisition strategy could potentially triple overall conversion rates
- **Customer Experience Gap**: Users encountering $0 prices and missing brands likely questioned site credibility, creating unnecessary friction

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Data Audit & Cleanup**
   - Perform comprehensive review of product listings
   - Fix missing brand information and pricing data
   - Implement data validation processes

### Growth Strategy
2. **Replicate November Success**
   - Investigate specific marketing campaigns, channels, and messaging used in November
   - Analyze user acquisition sources that drove higher-quality traffic
   - Identify what changed in targeting, creative, or channel mix
   - Scale successful acquisition methods and retire underperforming strategies
   - Establish ongoing cohort monitoring to track acquisition quality trends

## Key Learnings & Analytical Insights

### Methodological Breakthroughs
1. **Diagnostic Analysis**: Sequential analysis (overall → product → brand → user) revealed that surface level problems often mask deeper systemic issues
2. **Cohort Analysis**: Time based user segmentation proved more revealing than product-based analysis, showing that "when" users were acquired mattered more than "what" they viewed
3. **Data Quality as User Experience**: Missing data fields weren't just technical debt, they were active conversion killers affecting real customer journeys

### Business Intelligence Insights  
4. **Conversion Paradox**: High downstream conversion rates (66.2%) combined with low upstream rates indicated the business was losing the right customers at the wrong stage
5. **Marketing Attribution Gap**: Performance variations attributed to products were actually marketing acquisition differences - a critical misattribution that could have led to wrong product decisions
6. **Systematic vs. Random Issues**: The pattern of entire brands showing 0% conversion proved this wasn't random data corruption but systematic data management problems

### Analytical Techniques That Proved Valuable
- **Cross dimensional analysis**: Looking at the same problem through product, brand, and user lenses
- **Correlation vs. causation testing**: Session duration correlation led to deeper cohort investigation
- **Negative case analysis**: Focusing on 0% conversion products revealed the most insights

## Future Work

- Monitor data quality metrics to prevent similar issues
- A/B testing framework for user acquisition strategies
- Automated alerting for conversion rate anomalies
- Deeper analysis of November acquisition channels
